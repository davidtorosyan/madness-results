## Introduction

These are the results of running the March Madness prediction tool: [madness](https://github.com/davidtorosyan/madness).

Note that these predictions are just for fun, and probably no better than random.

## Usage

Results are organized by year. Check out the `results.txt` file for the bracket predictions - everything else is intermediary.
